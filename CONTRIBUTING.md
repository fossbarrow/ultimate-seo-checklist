## Prequirities

This repository serves as a database for info regarding how to improve SEO, with examples and details about what it actually does and why it's good for SEO.

A pull request should _not_ contain a list of things that are good for SEO, but rather subjects, featuring an example, a detailed description of how it's used, and why it's good for SEO.

Example: [Robots.txt for SEO](https://github.com/fossbarrow/ultimate-seo-checklist/tree/main/Robots.txt)

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
